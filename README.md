# 🏷️ CouponThryft

**CouponThryft** is a platform built for one purpose — **coupon trading**. Whether you're looking to **buy** a discount code or **sell** one you won’t use, this app makes it simple, fast, and secure.

> *“The coupon you might not need could be exactly what someone else is looking for.”*

Think of it as the marketplace for all those unused offers, promo codes, and discount deals sitting in your inbox. Let them go to someone who needs them — and maybe grab one in return.

## 🔥 Core Idea

People often have valid coupons they never use — and others are searching for that exact deal. **CouponThryft bridges that gap**, creating a **coupon economy** where users can:

- 🔁 **Trade** or exchange deals with the community
- 💸 **Sell** unused coupons
- 🛒 **Buy** coupons from others


It’s all about turning wasted discounts into real value.
